<a id="what-is-project-shell" class="anchor" href="#what-is-project-shell" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Project Shell?</h3>

<p>Project Shell is a purely Python bash replacement designed for everyday use. Currently you need to run it from the command line, but we will be changing this hopefully in the near future.</p>

<a id="why-project-shell" class="anchor" href="#why-project-shell" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Project Shell?</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>It's easy to contribute! You can easily add whatever feature that you want just by forking the repository and opening a pull request. Wait for the review to be accepted and you can use your new feature in the next release.</p></li>
<li><p>It's open source! Because of this, bugs are found relatively quickly and can be patched by the community. In addition, as mentioned above, any collaborator can add features, meaning that Project Shell has the potential to become the most versatile shell ever written!</p></li>
<li><p>It's written in Python! Show it off to all your fellow programmers. Tell them that you use a Python shell ;)</p></li>
</ol>
